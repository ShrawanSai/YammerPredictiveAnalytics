We've just published a new video about AI chatbots on our Youtube-channel 'Reporter'.

It's about the app 'Replika', that uses artificial intelligence to learn human interaction and can thus‡∞Æ‡∞∞‡∞ø‡∞®‡±ç‡∞®‡∞ø generate conversations, emotions and even relationships. At least that's how the developers advertise the app, promising users real friendships and even romantic relationships.
We wanted to know how this works, so we sent our reporter Max on a self-test. In the report, we show his experiences and whether a relationship with a chatbot actually comes close to human interaction. The video is in German language, but has English subtitles.

We'd be glad, if you check it out and leave your comment on YouTube.

Have you tried Replika? What is your opinion on these kinds of chatbots?
