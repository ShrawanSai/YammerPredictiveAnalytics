Any posts that are advertisements will be deleted and will be grounds for banishment from the group. You can however post genuine job postings provided you are not a recruiter.

If you wish to share information about a free educational resource such as new course on Coursera, edX or Udacity that you plan to sign up for or have taken in the past that is perfectly ok.

Bio 202 Bioinformatics - Sequence Analysis (ipak-edu.org)
Instructor: Dr. James Lyons-Weiler

Time Tuesdays 1:00PM-3:00PM

Amaze and astound your friends and family!

Imagine if you could analyze any DNA, RNA or protein sequence and run analyses on it to determine its likely identity, function, structure, relationships to other nucleotide sequences. If it's an RNA sequence, what is its likely structure? If it's DNA, does it encode a protein? Does the protein have a likely special function, or cellular location? Does the protein have conserved domains? If it's a viral or bacterial protein, does it have any immunogenic epitopes? If so, what are they, and do they match human proteins in a manner that might lead to pathogenic priming? Plus much, much more.

Nearly 100% of ""Homework"" is done IN-CLASS w/instructor guidance.

Syllabus
Course Description: This course will provide an introduction to some of the important fundamental skill sets in Bioinformatics. In-depth description of methods and algorithms will provide background and hands-on experience with software will provide practical experience. Concepts and approaches to DNA and amino acid sequence alignment, homology, conserved domain identification, phylogenetic inference, array-based transcriptomics, quantitative PCR analysis and peptide identification searches will be presented. Basic computing skills are required.

Learning Outcomes:
Students will
*Understand molecular biology of genes, transcription and translation beyond central dogma
*Search biological databases containing sequences, clinical, and structural information
*Retrieve information from these biological databases
*Perform structure/function analysis of biological molecules
*Perform DNA/protein sequence alignment and analysis
*Identify homologs and conserved domains
*Perform a basic phylogenetic inference from a multiple sequence alignment
*Identify differentially expressed genes in a microarray data set
*Be able to interpret the output of a quantitative RT-PCR experiment
*Understand peptide identification search algorithms given proteomics profiles
*Be able to detect structure in small RNAs

Time Tuesdays 1:00PM-3:00PM

Required Materials: Students will make extensive use of computers and the internet. PC software to be used includes various web applications.

Recommended Text(s): Recommended readings will be sent each week. The book that most closely parallels our in-class experiences is David Mount‚Äôs Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis. However, every student of Biotechnology should get and read a copy of Campbell & Heyer‚Äôs Discovering Genomics, Proteomics and Bioinformatics.

Directed Study: Data analysis using web-based database searches, sequence analysis, protein structure analysis, phylogenetic trees, transcriptomics, proteomic peptide identification, qPCR. Interpretation of current journal articles involving bioinformatics and QA/QC.

Teaching Methods:
Emphasis on learning by doing ‚Äì directed exercises in 1)use of a variety of web applications, 2) interpretation of results from those applications, 3) in-class/take-home exercises that build on past experiences, 4) in-class quizzes and exams.

The assignments and content will rely on web-based tutorials and specific assignments from bioinformatics web-sites. The tools and resources for bioinformatics are generally free to the public. They lend themselves to exploration, so students are encouraged to ask and seek answers for impromptu questions.
